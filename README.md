# Project  - *Travel Guide*

**Travel Guide** is an android app that allows a user to check out popular travel plans created by other travelers. It allows a user plan a trip based on preferences and crowd sourced information. The app utilizes information from travelers, location services, photos and [Trip Advisor APIs](https://developer-tripadvisor.com/content-api/)* to display information and images about tourist places across the globe.

\* Still pending of authorization from TripAdvisor they have a police that requires it.

Today, travelers spend up to three hours crawling the web (Ex: [TripAdvisor](www.tripadvisor.com)) in finding the places to visit/stay when planning for a trip. They do it because they want to tailor a plan to suit their needs/family needs so everyone can have a good time.

What we can do better is create an app where users can create travel/trip plans from their recent trips which can be shared with other travelers. By doing this travelers can spend less time in tailoring a plan and can spend more time on needed things. We will make an Android app as simple as possible by displaying places, others users plan.

In the future we could integrate with [TripAdvisor](www.tripadvisor.com) or [Yelp](www.yelp.com) to pull data. By now we're going to use Android features such as: camera, persitence and location services.
